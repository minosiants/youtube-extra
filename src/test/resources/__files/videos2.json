        "title": "Lord of the rings: the Spire numerical towers – Denis Rosset",
        "description": "Spire defines around 80 typeclasses, including 30 coming from algebra and cats-kernel. We’ll see how much of that structure is dictated by mathematical laws, and which parts are the result of design decisions that balance different tradeoffs. In particular, we’ll discuss the different roles played by typeclasses in the Scala ecosystem:\n\n- as encoding operations obeying well-defined laws,\n- as enabling the use of a particular syntax for those operations, if possible close to the mathematical notation of a domain (and subfields often disagree on the notation!),\n- defining a context in which a combination of typeclasses implicitly imposes additional laws (for example, the ordering of numbers and addition),\n- enabling the user to change the variant of a relation being used (Order),\n- singling out one variant of a structure as canonical (cats: the additive Group for integers),\n- as selecting a particular algorithm for an operation (integer factorization: deterministic or Monte-Carlo).\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that these roles conflict. With this in mind, we’ll have a look at some design choices made in Spire. We’ll discuss success stories, such as the clarification of the laws of the % operator, the commutative ring tower that formalizes integer factorization and Euclidean division. We’ll also discuss parts where trade offs have been made, such as the triplication of group structures (Group, AdditiveGroup, MultiplicativeGroup), the problem of coherent instances, especially when various typeclasses are combined. Time permitting, we’ll also discuss issues with law-based property checks (precision, range, time and memory complexity).\n\n* Event *\n\nTypelevel Summit Lausanne, June 2019: https://typelevel.org/event/2019-06-summit-lausanne/\n\n* About Speaker *\n\nI’m a researcher in quantum physics with a strong interest in convex optimization and numerical/symbolical computing. I’ve been using Scala&Play since I wanted to build a database of research results, and Play seemed to be a reasonable solution. I fell in love with the Scala language since then, and am contributing to its open source ecosystem (Spire + personal libraries for mathematical computations).\n\n* Licensing *\n\nThis recording is licensed under CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

          "title": "Lord of the rings: the Spire numerical towers – Denis Rosset",
          "description": "Spire defines around 80 typeclasses, including 30 coming from algebra and cats-kernel. We’ll see how much of that structure is dictated by mathematical laws, and which parts are the result of design decisions that balance different tradeoffs. In particular, we’ll discuss the different roles played by typeclasses in the Scala ecosystem:\n\n- as encoding operations obeying well-defined laws,\n- as enabling the use of a particular syntax for those operations, if possible close to the mathematical notation of a domain (and subfields often disagree on the notation!),\n- defining a context in which a combination of typeclasses implicitly imposes additional laws (for example, the ordering of numbers and addition),\n- enabling the user to change the variant of a relation being used (Order),\n- singling out one variant of a structure as canonical (cats: the additive Group for integers),\n- as selecting a particular algorithm for an operation (integer factorization: deterministic or Monte-Carlo).\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that these roles conflict. With this in mind, we’ll have a look at some design choices made in Spire. We’ll discuss success stories, such as the clarification of the laws of the % operator, the commutative ring tower that formalizes integer factorization and Euclidean division. We’ll also discuss parts where trade offs have been made, such as the triplication of group structures (Group, AdditiveGroup, MultiplicativeGroup), the problem of coherent instances, especially when various typeclasses are combined. Time permitting, we’ll also discuss issues with law-based property checks (precision, range, time and memory complexity).\n\n* Event *\n\nTypelevel Summit Lausanne, June 2019: https://typelevel.org/event/2019-06-summit-lausanne/\n\n* About Speaker *\n\nI’m a researcher in quantum physics with a strong interest in convex optimization and numerical/symbolical computing. I’ve been using Scala&Play since I wanted to build a database of research results, and Play seemed to be a reasonable solution. I fell in love with the Scala language since then, and am contributing to its open source ecosystem (Spire + personal libraries for mathematical computations).\n\n* Licensing *\n\nThis recording is licensed under CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)."

        "description": "GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types) are a special case of ADTs (or Dotty enums) that, when we match on them, let us know more about type parameters to enclosing functions. In practice, they are mostly used to associate types with data constructors (case classes and objects in Scala’s case), and to ensure that incorrectly assembling data structures will not typecheck. Two good examples are a database query type that cannot be malformed (no integers as if conditions!) or a red-black tree data type that will only compile if it is balanced. So far Scala’s support for GADTs has been lacking and rife with runtime type errors compared to Haskell. Fortunately, I’ve been working on making it far better in Dotty! During the talk first we’ll walk through examples of GADTs, see what makes them useful and how they can be applied to solve real problems. Next, I’ll explain how GADTs in Scala naturally follow from subtyping and inheritance, completely unlike Haskell or any other language with GADTs. Finally, I’ll talk about how the support for GADTs in Dotty is tightly related to other features such as match types and (the possible) nullable types.\n\n* Material *\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2VO2DyaJtgzQkk4UTNtWWlyRnUtTENZWGFBc3c1UUl0ckEw/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Event *\n\nTypelevel Summit Lausanne, June 2019: https://typelevel.org/event/2019-06-summit-lausanne/\n\n* About Speaker *\n\nI’m Martin Odersky’s freshest PhD student, interested in GADTs, typelevel programming and effect systems.

So far Scala’s support for GADTs has been lacking and rife with runtime type errors compared to Haskell. Fortunately, I’ve been working on making it far better in Dotty! During the talk first we’ll walk through examples of GADTs, see what makes them useful and how they can be applied to solve real problems. Next, I’ll explain how GADTs in Scala naturally follow from subtyping and inheritance, completely unlike Haskell or any other language with GADTs. Finally, I’ll talk about how the support for GADTs in Dotty is tightly related to other features such as match types and (the possible) nullable types.\n\n* Material *\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2VO2DyaJtgzQkk4UTNtWWlyRnUtTENZWGFBc3c1UUl0ckEw/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Event *\n\nTypelevel Summit Lausanne, June 2019: https://typelevel.org/event/2019-06-summit-lausanne/\n\n* About Speaker *\n\nI’m Martin Odersky’s freshest PhD student, interested in GADTs, typelevel programming and effect systems. Before coming to EPFL, I spent four years working in the industry on back- and front-ends of web applications and dealing with the abomination known as TeamSite. Also, I drink frankly absurd amounts of coffee.\n\n* Licensing *\n\nThis recording is licensed under CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)."

        "description": "The Scala community has grown significantly over the past 15 years. As a community, we wrote millions of lines of code and developed hundreds of projects. While the language is thriving, there is still room to contribute to the community. Different from other tech talks, this talk focuses on contributing to the diversity aspect of the community. It explains the significance and benefits of diversity, and it proposes solutions to diversify and improve the community. One of the best ways to grow the community and to bring diversity into the community is to organize ScalaBridge workshops, which are intended to provide resources for people from underrepresented populations to learn Scala. (Diversity comes in many forms: race, gender, age, religion, culture, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, etc.) While the workshops have positive and lasting impacts, it cannot be done by one individual or by a single organization. In order for the Scala community to become more diverse, we need your help to scale up! Attend this talk to learn about how to contribute to our community!\n\n* Material *\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MUrEI-fdP-Ak5OZ3SopnDhxL-K8jjqfp/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Event *\n\nTypelevel Summit Lausanne, June 2019: https://typelevel.org/event/2019-06-summit-lausanne/\n\n* About Speaker *\n\nYifan is a software engineer, ScalaBridge organizer, and open-source contributor.
