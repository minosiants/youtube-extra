Combining Http4s, fs2, and Doobie makes for a powerful recipe that is ridiculously easy to use. As of Doobie 0.7.0, Quill has joined the fray, bridging the gap to the database layer. You can now model your data layer, compose it into queries, transact it, and send it out to the world, without ever having to leave the functional paradigm. By creating this integration, both Doobie and Quill get more than the sum of their parts. Doobie for instance, leverages fs2 to get rich set of effect-level JDBC operations that support everything from parallel-streaming queries, to reactive monitoring of asynchronous events from database change-listeners. Typically, the SQL queries for these varying use-cases will be similar but also different in non-trivial ways. This is where Quill comes to the rescue, allowing the common parts of SQL-queries to be abstracted away from the uncommon parts, ensuring a very DRY and maintainable solution, especially when the queries get very, very big.

This talk zooms in on one aspect of Unison: it models the codebase not as a mutable bag of text files, but as a purely functional data structure. We&#39;ll explain what that means and show the benefits of the approach, which include: * Perfect incremental compilation and testing, with the compilation and test result caches shared among all collaborators * Refactoring of any size as a totally controlled experience where the codebase always typechecks and the code is always runnable * Instant, 100% accurate renames that never break downstream libraries or users * The ability to assign multiple names to the same definition, with all namings being fully compatible with one another * Simplified and more flexible dependency management; many causes of dependency hell simply cannot arise * The ability to serialize arbitrary Unison code, simply, without dependency management issues * And lots more...

Different from other tech talks, this talk focuses on contributing to the diversity aspect of the community. It explains the significance and benefits of diversity, and it proposes solutions to diversify and improve the community. One of the best ways to grow the community and to bring diversity into the community is to organize ScalaBridge workshops, which are intended to provide resources for people from underrepresented populations to learn Scala. (Diversity comes in many forms: race, gender, age, religion, culture, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, etc.) While the workshops have positive and lasting impacts, it cannot be done by one individual or by a single organization.

When we add big data from non homogenous sources to the mix, this problem becomes exponentially complex. One of the use cases at Netflix, is about improving the Sign Up experience through experimentation. Being able to find user journeys across billions of events; that follow certain patterns, is a key insight into simplifying the sign up process. This gave us an idea to build a framework to express these user journey patterns that could be translated into a Non Deterministic Finite State Machine. One of the ideas that we adapted from Ken Thompson&#39;s 1968 CACM paper, was to create a Non Deterministic Finite Automaton around patterns defined using regex. The next step was applying the state machine across billions of events at scale using Spark. The final piece to the puzzle was to make it easily usable by Data Engineers, Scientists and Analysts alike. In this talk, we will cover how we built this framework (dubbed &quot;Conduit&quot;) and the design decisions resulting from challenges along the way. We will also talk about how this can be adapted to real time applications in the future.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qyzVWq1aSUg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qyzVWq1aSUg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qyzVWq1aSUg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qyzVWq1aSUg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT33M33S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"113","likeCount":"1","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"MdYKEwuWR4U","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2020-01-18T01:04:24Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"SBTB 2019: Salar Rahmanian &amp; John A.

Based on our current work with customers, our platform, when used for a medical imaging use case, provides up to 5X improvement over the range of queries executed commonly in the field and can save upwards of 2 months per data scientist per machine learning deployment for every new application that wants to exploit data to gather insights. What other makeshift solutions fail to address is that once AI is ready to be commercialized, managing the onslaught of real visual data is going to be a killer for real deployments. Our talk will explain how ApertureData Platform achieves the performance and functionality for a wide range of application domains as well as a demo to show how to use it.<br/><br/>Vishakha Gupta-Cledat<br/>ApertureData<br/>Founder and CEO<br/>Cupertino, CA<br/>Websitehttps://aperturedata.io<br/>I am the Founder and CEO of ApertureData.

Data collection and labeling is often the rate-limiting step of AI research. At Curai, our AI tools are deployed in a real-world healthcare setting, giving us the opportunity to learn from their usage. This talk will focus on how to build a semi-automated data feedback loop for ML model retraining, highlighting the specific use case at Curai. A data feedback loop consists of several key components. First, model output is presented to the user (in our case, a doctor or health professional), who can choose to accept or reject a medical suggestion. This usage data is then sent to data sinks and forwarded to a data store, where post-processing and additional calculations can happen (for example, calculating the edit distance between two strings). Processed data can then be sent down (most simply, through a CSV) to a model for retraining or fine-tuning, and the resulting v2 model can then be tested for accuracy and re-deployed into the product. In short, the semi-automated data feedback loop allows for rapid iteration and continuous learning for AI/ML models. This talk will focus on specific technologies I and my teammates have used, including, but not limited to, integration with StackDriver, BigQuery, and LaunchDarkly. Attendees will learn how to build a semi-automated data feedback loop, practical code examples and anecdotes of my own failures and successes in this domain, and ethical implications of using user-generated data for model retraining. There is tremendous potential for AI in healthcare, and closing the data loop for model retraining can help solve one of the key challenges in this domain and continuously improve machine learning models.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6nVn-crwTFU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6nVn-crwTFU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6nVn-crwTFU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6nVn-crwTFU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT26M39S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"85","likeCount":"4","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"zQGXXwMZfO0","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2019-12-10T02:02:01Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019: Gabor Melli, Large Scale On-Demand Low-Latency Near Real-Time Predictions","description":"Predictive machine learning is optimizing customer experiences across many industries.

Even though individual functions in these libraries are optimized, the lack of end-to-end optimization can cause order of magnitude slowdowns in the whole workflow compared to a tuned implementation written in C. For example, even though TensorFlow uses highly tuned linear algebra functions for each of its operators, workflows that combine these operators can be 16x slower than hand-tuned code. Similarly, workflows that perform relational processing in Spark SQL or Pandas, numerical processing in NumPy, or a combination of these tasks spend much of their time in data movement across processing functions and could run up to 100× faster if optimized end to end. Weld is an ongoing open source project from Stanford to accelerate data-intensive applications by as much as 100×. It does so by JIT-compiling parallel code and optimizing across functions within a single library as well as across different libraries, so developers can write modular code and still get close to bare metal performance without incurring expensive data movement costs. Weld&#39;s compiler uses a new, explicitly parallel functional intermediate representation to capture the structure of data-parallel workloads such as SQL, machine learning, and graph analytics and then optimizes across them using adaptive optimizer that takes into account hardware characteristics. We demonstrate how Weld can be incrementally integrated into these libraries by porting only the most impactful operators first without breaking compatibility with other operators in the library, and without changing the API of the libraries (so users do not need to change their application code). We also show how Weld speeds up existing workloads in these frameworks and enables speed-ups of two orders of magnitude in applications that combine them. The Weld library and Weld-enabled versions of the Pandas and NumPy libraries are available to download on PyPi. Weld is open source at https://www.weld.rs.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jJUA_JSCyo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jJUA_JSCyo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jJUA_JSCyo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jJUA_JSCyo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT31M5S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"138","likeCount":"1","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"hLm_duqB3Y4","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2019-12-24T01:31:56Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019: Jacques Nadeau, Vectorized Query Processing for CPUs using Apache Arrow","description":"Title: Vectorized Query Processing for CPUs and GPUs using Apache Arrow<br/><br/>Query processing technology has seen rapid development since the iconic C-Store paper was published in 2005. The focus has been on designing query processing algorithms and data structures that efficiently utilize CPU and leverage the changing trends in hardware to deliver optimal performance. In this talk we will explore different types of vectorized query processing in Dremio using Apache Arrow. Abstract Columnar data has become the de facto format for building high performance query engines that run analytical workloads. Apache Arrow is an in-memory columnar data format that houses canonical in-memory representations for both flat and nested data structures. It is a natural complement to on-disk formats like Apache Parquet and Apache ORC. Data stored in a columnar format is amenable to processing using vectorized instructions (SIMD) available on all modern architectures. Query processing algorithms can implement simple and efficient code that operates on the columnar values in a tight-loop, providing fast and CPU cache-friendly access patterns. Operations like SUM, FILTER, COUNT, MIN, MAX etc on columnar data can be made more efficient by leveraging the data-level parallelism property of SIMD instructions. Columnar data can be encoded using lightweight algorithms like dictionary encoding, run length encoding, bit packing and delta encoding that are far more CPU efficient than general purpose compression algorithms like LZO and ZLIB. Furthermore, vectorized query processing algorithms can be written in a manner that are aware of column level encoding and can easily operate on the compressed column values in some cases. This saves CPU-memory bandwidth since we need only decompress the necessary column values. Columnar format allows us to efficiently utilize CPU and GPU cache by filling cache lines with related data (column values from an in-memory vector). With the increasing use of GPUs and FPGAs, efficient use of the smaller on-chip memory available in these architectures is especially important. In addition, Apache Arrow allows for zero-copy, shared access to buffers so that multiple processes can more efficiently operate on the same data. On the storage side, columnar representation of on-disk data makes a good case for efficient utilization of disk I/O bandwidth for analytical queries. Dremio’s query processing engine leverages columnar format of Apache Arrow and Parquet for in-memory and on-disk representations respectively. We have vectorized implementations of operators like hash join and hash aggregation to name a few.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hLm_duqB3Y4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hLm_duqB3Y4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hLm_duqB3Y4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hLm_duqB3Y4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT31M53S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"372","likeCount":"17","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"H44yonKxH1I","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2020-01-01T21:08:14Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019: Oli Makhasoeva Interview","description":"Check out Oli&#39;s talks here:<br/>https://youtu.be/QEjhS2xuunE<br/><br/>https://youtu.be/tP77Ryy9Qxs<br/><br/>Oli Makhasoeva<br/>47 Degrees<br/>Solutions Architect<br/>Bellevue, Washington<br/>twitter.com/Oli_kitty","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H44yonKxH1I/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H44yonKxH1I/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H44yonKxH1I/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H44yonKxH1I/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT5M33S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"42","likeCount":"0","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"3uymOAViiAQ","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2020-01-01T21:08:20Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019: Rashmi Shamprasad Interview","description":"Check out Rashmi&#39;s talk here: https://youtu.be/qyzVWq1aSUg<br/><br/>Rashmi Shamprasad<br/>Netflix<br/>Senior Data Engineer<br/>Passionate about all things data, Rashmi Shamprasad is a Senior Data Engineer on the Growth Data Engineering team at Netflix, building data products that enable Non Member Acquisition &amp; Experimentation.

What is the role of algorithmic design in this?  I will show several ways to infuse structure into deep networks to overcome these limitations, viz., through tensors, graphs, physical laws, and simulations. Tensorized neural networks lead to large rates of compression while improving on generalization and robustness. In order to speed up multi-node model training, I will demonstrate how simple gradient compression (SignSGD) leads to communication savings while preserving accuracy. Thus, with better algorithmic design, it is possible to obtain “free lunches” and obtain better efficiency in ML.<br/><br/>Anima Anandkumar<br/>Caltech<br/>Professor<br/>Anima Anandkumar holds dual positions in academia and industry.

We started building Metaflow at Netflix to provide a solid foundation for hundreds of internal ML use cases, from classical statistical analysis to large-scale applications of deep learning. Metaflow is designed with a human-centric mindset: instead of reinventing the wheel for large-scale computing or machine learning, we integrate existing solutions into a delightfully consistent and easy-to-use package. This talk focuses on our philosophy towards Machine Learning infrastructure and dives into the internals of Metaflow; it will highlight lessons that we have learned in building a Python library that needs to be robust, performant, and flexible enough to solve a large set of complex real-world business problems related to machine learning. This talk is for you if you want to learn how to develop systems for big data and ML in Python.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yyWirT279tY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yyWirT279tY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yyWirT279tY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yyWirT279tY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT30M3S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"159","likeCount":"9","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"ahNAfesXAI0","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2020-01-17T02:57:31Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019 Unconference: Sergei Winitzki, Reasoning about types and code","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ahNAfesXAI0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ahNAfesXAI0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ahNAfesXAI0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ahNAfesXAI0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT23M26S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"84","likeCount":"2","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"62ihVJ0583Y","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2020-01-17T02:57:31Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019 UnConference: Sergei Winitzki, What did category theory do for us?","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62ihVJ0583Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62ihVJ0583Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62ihVJ0583Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62ihVJ0583Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT41M46S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"175","likeCount":"9","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"ffCqPSiOXhM","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2020-01-17T02:57:32Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019 UnConference: Sara Moore, Intro and Overview to Rust","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffCqPSiOXhM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffCqPSiOXhM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffCqPSiOXhM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffCqPSiOXhM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT24M35S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"131","likeCount":"1","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"0"}},{"id":"zjBEdFQP-ps","snippet":{"channelTitle":"FunctionalTV","publishedAt":"2020-01-17T02:57:31Z","channelId":"UCKvhw2CPR-0S4XZ1bNlihnw","title":"Scale By The Bay 2019 UnConference: Jess Haberman, What Not to do When Pitching a Book","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zjBEdFQP-ps/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zjBEdFQP-ps/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zjBEdFQP-ps/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zjBEdFQP-ps/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":null},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M23S","dimension":"2d"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"52","likeCount":"2","dislikeCount":"1","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"1"}}]}`);
